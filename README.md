# AquaCropGymnasium

AquaCropGymnasium is a reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on [AquaCrop-OSPy](https://aquacropos.github.io/aquacrop/) and integrated with [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/). This project is an adaptation of the [AquaCrop-Gym](https://github.com/aquacropos/aquacrop-gym) repository, updated to support AquaCropOSPy version **3.0.9** and Gymnasium version **0.29**.

## Overview

AquaCropGymnasium provides a simulation environment for training RL agents on crop growth modeling and water resource management. By leveraging the AquaCropOSPy model, it simulates crop yield responses to water, enabling researchers and practitioners to develop intelligent irrigation strategies.

## Features

- **Updated Dependencies**: Compatible with AquaCropOSPy 3.0.9 and Gymnasium 0.29.
- **Reinforcement Learning Ready**: Seamlessly integrate with Stable-Baselines3 for training and evaluation.
